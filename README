XML::SMART

XML::Smart - A Smart, easy and powerful way to access/create XML files/data.



DESCRIPTION

This module has an easy way to access/create XML data. It's based on the HASH
tree that is made of the XML data, and enable a dynamic access to it with the
Perl syntax for Hash and Array, without needing to care if you have a Hash or an
Array in the tree. In other words, B<each point in the tree work as a Hash and
an Array at the same time>!

You also have extra resources, like a search for nodes by attribute, selection
of an attribute value in each multiple node,  change the returned format, etc...

The module alson handle automatically binary data (encoding/decoding to/from base64),
CDATA (like contents with <tags>) and Unicode. It can be used to create XML files,
load XML from the Web (just pasting an URL as a file path) and it has an easy
way to send XML data through socket, just adding the length of the data in
the <?xml?> header.

You can use XML::Smart with XML::Parser, or with the 2 standart parsers of
XML::Smart:

   XML::Smart::Parser 
   XML::Smart::HTMLParser
